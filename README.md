# Pathfinder-visualizer
# About
This project helps us to visualize us to see all the paths taken by the algorithm before reaching the destination. By viewing the results we can visually verify the efficiency of the algorithm while it executes. The algorithms visualized in this project are

    BFS
    DFS
    Dijkstra's algorithm

# Demo
Here are some pictures of the project while working
